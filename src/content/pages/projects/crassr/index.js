    This is a very entry, low-level YouTube video on how to server-side render a React application
    bootstrapped with the create-react-app CLI. Within I cover how to implement react-router
    and the fundementals of running a noder server along with utilizing react server-side. All the
    renderToString goodies that come along with.

    Although, this is never meant to be used in production it provides a very good intro into the more
    extreme boilerplates out there and what they're doing under the hood to server-side render. I've received
    a very good feedback on this video and plan to create more in the future.

    The video is long, clocking at 36:06, I don't skip any portion from using 'create-react-app init myProject'
    all the way to deploying the server-side rendered application.
