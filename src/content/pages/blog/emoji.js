    NOTE: I've since updated this website and added a dependency, react-router-redux (awesome library), which does not suppose Emoji in the URL.

    Emojis can be in the URL!!! Well, kind of.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Emojis can be in path names but not domain names, at least not of major domain names (.com, .org, .co.uk). The only domain with full browser support is .ws. Check out üí©.ws for en example of how this behave/looks in browser.

    <br/>
    If you do get a chic domain name with an emoji in it: how do you navigate to the URL while on the computer? Another gotcha.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The only way I'll be experimenting with Emojis in the domain name is if I have another domain that redirects to the Emoji domain--annoying.

    But hey, look at the URl bar now. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
