    I had some minor Twitter drama recently (12/31/2016) about Javascript tooling. Here's the original tweet's text:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'Have we all just over complicated the web? We don't need webpck, sass, iconfonts and all these things just to put a form on a screen.'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I replied with:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'You've been on /r/javascript too much my friend. ;-)'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    and was shortly blocked.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Although, he had a very good point for some forms of web development (i.e. static sites, Wordpress, etc.), this isn't really applicable to a lot of what I've been doing in 2015 and onward. Tools such as Webpack, Gulp, Rollup, Sass, and various CLIs come in handy, a lot, but not for creating websites. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tools such as these become necessary with complex web applications (Google Docs, Netflix, the application my dentist uses to keep track of patient recrods, etc.). I would never think to add React and Webpack to some of our closer-to-static sites we maintain at my current employer.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Even if you're not currently making web applications, but instead primiraly web sites: learn webpack, learn gulp, sass, react-scripts CLI, learn. (!) You might not need the information, but if you want to progress your career then learn. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The type of attitude seen in the tweet above is the same attitude my peers while a sophmore in high school geometry had when saying:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    'Are we ever going to use this in real life?'
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Maybe! And if you do you'll be glad you already have the knowledge under your belt.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Love learning in 2017.
