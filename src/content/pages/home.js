    My name is Evan Jones.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I like making mobile apps and web applications.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I do a lot of Node and React in my free time. Currently employed at a place called Crowdhub Apps as a full-stack web developer doing a lot of Vue, PHP, and MySQL.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In my free time I like to eat chicken nuggets, drink too much, and stare at brightly lit rectangles. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Anyways, this site is a front for people to get to know me and know how to contact me. Hit me up and lets do something rad!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers
